At the end of 2022 I made the version version of this site using some template I found on Vercel. It was based on Next.js and Remark. After I published the site on Vercel I haven't bothered about updating it. Since 2023 Summer I became a fan of Svelte (and Sveltekit) so it seemed like a good idea to update and compare the new version of the my blog.

## Tech stack

The main goal was to keep it as simple as possible and try to generate stuff at build time rather than type it manually.

I chose Sveltekit, TailwindCSS and MDsveX.
